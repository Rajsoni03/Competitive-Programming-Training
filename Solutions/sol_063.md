# Next Greater Element II - [Practice - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/)


Given a circular integer array `nums` (i.e., the next element of `nums[nums.length - 1]` is `nums[0]`), return the next greater number for every element in `nums`.
<br>
The next greater number of a number `x` is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return `-1` for this number.




Example:1
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1]

Output: [2,-1,2]

Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```
Example:2
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]

Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nextGreaterElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        stack<int> s;
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ans(n);

        for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--){
            while(!s.empty() && s.top() <= nums[i]){
                s.pop();			
            }
            s.push(nums[i]);
        }

        for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--){
            while(!s.empty() && s.top() <= nums[i]){
                s.pop();			
            }
            if (s.empty()){
                ans[i] = -1;
            }
            else{
                ans[i] = s.top();
            }
            s.push(nums[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
