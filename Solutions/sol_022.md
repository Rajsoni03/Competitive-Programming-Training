# Number of 1 Bits - [Practice - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).


Example:1
```
Input: 
n = 00000000000000000000000000001011

Output: 
3

Explanation: 
The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```
Example:2
```
Input: 
n = 00000000000000000000000010000000

Output: 
1

Explanation: 
The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```

## Solution 1 : using while loop

Time - O(1)<br>
Space - O(1)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n){
            if (n & 1) count++;
            n>>=1;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

## Solution 2 : using for loop

Time - O(1)<br>
Space - O(1)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++){
            if (n & 1<<i) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
