# Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number - [Practice - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-bit-flips-to-convert-number/)

A bit flip of a number x is choosing a bit in the binary representation of `x` and flipping it from either `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`.
<br>
For example, for `x = 7`, the binary representation is `111` and we may choose any bit (including any leading zeros not shown) and flip it. We can flip the first bit from the right to get `110`, flip the second bit from the right to get `101`, flip the fifth bit from the right (a leading zero) to get `10111`, etc.
<br>
Given two integers start and goal, return the minimum number of bit flips to convert start to goal.


Example:1
```
Input: 
start = 10, goal = 7

Output: 
3

Explanation: 
The binary representation of 10 and 7 are 1010 and 0111 respectively. We can convert 10 to 7 in 3 steps:
- Flip the first bit from the right: 1010 -> 1011.
- Flip the third bit from the right: 1011 -> 1111.
- Flip the fourth bit from the right: 1111 -> 0111.
It can be shown we cannot convert 10 to 7 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.
```
Example:2
```
Input: 
start = 3, goal = 4

Output: 
3

Explanation: 
The binary representation of 3 and 4 are 011 and 100 respectively. We can convert 3 to 4 in 3 steps:
- Flip the first bit from the right: 011 -> 010.
- Flip the second bit from the right: 010 -> 000.
- Flip the third bit from the right: 000 -> 100.
It can be shown we cannot convert 3 to 4 in less than 3 steps. Hence, we return 3.

## Solution 1  

Time - O(1)<br>
Space - O(1)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
        int count  = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++){
            if ((start & (1<<i)) != (goal & (1<<i))) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

## Solution 2 

Time - O(1)<br>
Space - O(1)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
        int XOR = start ^ goal;
        int count  = 0;
        
        while(XOR){
           if (XOR & 1) count++;
           XOR >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
