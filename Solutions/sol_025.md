# Hamming Distance - [Practice - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/)


The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
<br>

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.



Example:1
```
Input: 
x = 1, y = 4

Output: 
2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```
Example:2
```
Input: 
x = 3, y = 1

Output: 
1
```

## Solution 1  

Time - O(1)<br>
Space - O(1)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int count  = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++){
            if ((x & (1<<i)) != (y & (1<<i))) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

## Solution 2 

Time - O(1)<br>
Space - O(1)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int XOR = x ^ y;
        int count  = 0;
        
        while(XOR){
           if (XOR & 1) count++;
           XOR >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
